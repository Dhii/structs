Create immutable and type-safe data-only objects.

## Introduction

Often times our code needs to move sets of data around between various units; data models, database records,
configuration, nodes, etc. Due to missing features in PHP (at the time of writing), the only way to have these data
sets be immutable **and** type-safe is to declare a class with `protected` properties and define corresponding getter
methods for each property.

Furthermore, is common to require such data sets to be instantiated from a simpler data type, such as a native PHP
`array`, or converted int one, especially when dealing with PHP built-in functions or third party libraries.

It's quite a cumbersome task to implement getters, immutable copy setters and conversion methods. That's why this
package exists; it introduces a user-land version of structs: data-only classes that are type-safe, immutable, can be
converted to and from associative arrays, as well as being fully serializable. 

## Usage

Extend the `Struct` abstract class and declare the `propTypes()`:

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Struct;
use Dhii\Structs\Ty;

/**
 * For IDE IntelliSense auto-completion,
 * declare the properties in the class docblock:
 *
 * @property-read string $url
 * @property-read int $width
 * @property-read int $height
 */
class Image extends Struct
{
    public static function propTypes() : array
    {
        return [
            'url' => Ty::string(),
            'width' => Ty::int(),
            'height' => Ty::int(),
        ];
    }
}
```

You can then access the struct's properties using PHP's property accessor syntax:

```php
$image = new Image([
    'url' => "http://example.com/image.png",
    'width' => 800,
    'height' => 600,
]);

$image->url; // "http://example.com/image.png"
$image->width; // 800
$image->height; // 600
```

Custom constructors _may_ be defined. However be wary that this will prevent you from creating instances from arrays.

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Struct;

class Image extends Struct
{
    // Overriding constructors should call the parent constructor
    public function __construct(string $url, int $width, int $height) {
        parent::__construct([
            'url' => $url,
            'width' => $width,
            'height' => $height
        ]);
    }

    public static function propTypes() : array { /* ... */ }
}
```

Consider adding a static "factory" method instead of a constructor.  
This will also ensure that you struct instances are truly data-only.

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Struct;

class Image extends Struct
{
    public static function propTypes() : array { /* ... */ }

    public static function create(string $url, int $width, int $height) {
        return new static([
            'url' => $url,
            'width' => $width,
            'height' => $height
        ]);
    }
}
```

Structs can be copied using the `derive()` static method, which leaves the original struct unchanged. Multiple
property changes may be specified in bulk:

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Struct;

$image2 = Struct::derive($image, ['url' => 'https://example.com/image2.png']);

$flipped = Struct::derive($image, [
    'width' => $image->height,
    'height' => $image->width
]);
```

When extending a struct, you may override the `propTypes()` method to add new properties.

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Ty;

class NamedImage extends Image
{
    public static function propTypes() : array {
        $propTypes = parent::propTypes();
        $propTypes['name'] = Ty::string();

        return $propTypes;
    }
}
```

**Some advice**: Take care if altering the parent struct's existing prop types to make sure that new types are
covariant. And remember, removing or renaming properties breaks [LSP][lsp].

## Property Types

| Type | Values |
|--------|------|
| `Ty::mixed()` | Any value |
| `Ty::bool()` | Booleans and [boolean-castable][bools] values |
| `Ty::int()` | Integers and [integer-castable][ints] values |
| `Ty::float()` | Floats and [float-castable][floats] values |
| `Ty::string()` | Strings, [string-castable][strings] values and objects that implement [`__toString()`][stringables] |
| `Ty::array()` | Array values |
| `Ty::arrayLike()` | Array values and [`ArrayAccess`][array-access] objects |
| `Ty::iterable()` | [Iterable values][iterables] |
| `Ty::object(...)` | Object values, with an optional parent class restrictions |
| `Ty::callable()` | [Callable values][callables] |
| `Ty::enum(...)` | Values that exist within a pre-defined set |
| `Ty::union(...)` | Values that match **at least one** type in a given set |
| `Ty::intersect(...)` | Values that match **all** of the types in a given set |
| `Ty::nullable(?)` | Values that match a given type, or `null` |
| `Ty::custom(?)` | Define a custom prop type |

Examples:

```php
use Dhii\Structs\Struct;
use Dhii\Structs\Ty;

class MyStruct extends Struct
{
    public static function propTypes() : array {
        return [
            // Nullable object type
            'owner' => Ty::nullable(Ty::object(DateTime::class)),

            // Enum type (of strings)
            'day' => Ty::enum('sun', 'mon', 'tues', 'wed', 'thurs', 'fri', 'sat'),

            // Either an array or an object
            'config' => Ty::union(Ty::array(), Ty::object()),

            // An object that implements Traversable AND Serializable
            'list' => Ty::object(Traversable::class, Serializable::class),

            // A custom type
            'total' => Ty::custom(function ($value) {
                if (is_int($value)) {
                    return $value;
                }
                if (is_array($value)) {
                    return array_sum($value);
                }
                throw new TypeError('Property value must be int or array');
            })
        ];
    }
}
```

## Embracing Static

Data processing and transformation methods are typically written as instance methods, which defeat the purpose of using
structs.

This is where static functionality can be put to good use. By declaring static methods, you maintain data-only struct
instances while also providing necessary or useful functionality, without having to deal with loading function files.

There are other benefits that come with static functionality, such as the ability to seamlessly invoke "methods" as
functions without the need for reflection. This benefit can become especially prominent when using array functions such
as `array_map` or `array_reduce`.

See the example in [demo/example.php](demo/example.php).

## Performance

Using a user-land replacement for a traditional class will naturally impact performance.

We tested our struct implementation against a traditional class with equivalent properties, corresponding getter
methods and a constructor.

* **Classes used:** [demo/comparison.php](demo/comparison.php)
* **Benchmark test:** [demo/benchmark.php](demo/benchmark.php)

The test consisted of constructing an instance of each and reading all of the properties in sequence. Below are the
average results after 100 tests were run on an ArchLinux machine with a Core i7-6700K CPU clocked at 4.4GHz, with memory
clocking at 2666MHz, with no form of caching enabling.

**Results**:

| Num Props | Impact                  |
| ---------:|:------------------------|
| 10 props  | `0.000057` seconds slower |
| 5 props   | `0.000039` seconds slower |
| 3 props   | `0.000018` seconds slower |

These differences are, in our humble opinion, very acceptable. You would need to construct thousands of struct instances
before a performance difference becomes noticeable.

In contrast, the amount of code required to write a PHP class that guarantees type safety and is immutable grows
exponentially with the number of properties, whereas a struct sees only 1 added line per property (2 if you document
the property in the class docblock).

Ultimately, we are willing to sacrifice a very small amount of performance for added maintainability and peace of mind.
